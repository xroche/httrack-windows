Hello,

Here are the sources of the shell interface of WinHTTrack Website Copier III, for Visual C++ 2008

The shell interface code was started at the very begining of HTTrack, and is very, *VERY* ditry, not documented, and therefore not easy to (re)use.

These sources can be useful if you want to understand how to make another version, or a version for another OS.

Use this code at your own risks!!


Have fun,
Xavier Roche (Author)
